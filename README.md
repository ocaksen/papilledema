# DETECTION PAPILLEDEMA ON FUNDUS CAMERA WITH CNN


## PROJECT OBJECTIVES
The project objectives are grouped under the following 3 main headings:
Obtaining Retina Image Without Using Mydriatics:
The fundus camera device used to obtain Retina Image in Eye Clinics uses visible light to obtain retinal image. The use of visible light causes miosis (shrinking of the pupil) in the eye while the device is shooting, and mydriatics are used to prevent this. Mydriatics are drugs that act by stopping mydriasis in patients for a short time, and it is necessary to wait for half an hour after administration for them to take effect. Within the scope of the project, it is aimed to obtain Retina Image without the use of mydriatics in order to prevent this process and facilitate the treatment. It is planned to use infrared lights and infrared camera technology that do not trigger miosis in the eye.
Designing a Retina Image Capture Device that Does Not Require Expertise to Use:
Retina Images are images that are frequently needed in other polyclinics apart from Eye Polyclinics. Fundus camera devices used to obtain retinal images are expensive and portable devices that require technical expertise. This situation makes it impossible to obtain Retina Image in outpatient clinics other than Eye Polyclinics and unnecessarily increases the demand for consultation to the Eye Polyclinics of other polyclinics, thus increasing the density of the Eye Polyclinics unnecessarily. Within the scope of the project, it is aimed to develop a portable Retina Image Capture Device that is easy to use in other outpatient clinics, does not require technical expertise and is portable.
Papilledema Detection Using CNN Structure:
Papilledema is a serious and important finding especially for Neurology Outpatient Clinics. As a matter of fact, detection of papilledema in examination requires experience or Ophthalmology expertise in terms of eye findings. For this reason, a large number of patients are sent to the Eye Polyclinic for consultation every day for papilledema examination, and this creates a serious workload. In project scope; It has been determined as the primary and main goal to integrate a CNN infrastructure that will provide decision support to the physician about the findings of papilledema in the designed device.

a) Retina Images Obtained by Fundus Camera:

Headache is the most common clinical symptom worldwide. The lifetime prevalence of headache was calculated as 96%. This clinical complaint, which almost everyone experiences at least once in their lifetime, constitutes the majority of patients who apply to neurology outpatient clinics. There are primary and secondary causes of headache. Although headaches due to primary causes reduce the quality of life, they are not life-threatening. Clinical conditions such as brain tumors that are secondary causes of headache and life-threatening, and increased intracranial hypertension that can cause permanent vision loss can be understood with a simple, inexpensive and non-invasive method such as fundus evaluation. Although it is a cheap and easily accessible examination, fundus evaluation should be performed by experienced physicians. For this reason, it is very common to consult eye diseases in order to better evaluate patients with headache complaints. These patients, who were consulted with an ophthalmologist, both increase the workload and increase the patient density due to the fact that they are examined in an extra department. In addition, mydriatic (pupillary enlargement) group drugs are given to patients for examination in Ophthalmology outpatient clinics, and this group of drugs causes a loss of time since the effect time is about half an hour.
Retinal imaging is routinely provided with a fundus camera in the clinic. Images taken with a fundus camera are kept in the hospital database in digital environment. Normal and papilledema images in the database will be selected by the ophthalmologist and included in the project (Figure-1). Since the device planned to be turned into a product in the project will also receive fundus camera-like images, it was deemed appropriate to process retinal images obtained with a fundus camera within the scope of the project.
