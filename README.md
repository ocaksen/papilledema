PROJECT TITLE ALHAZEN: DETECTION PAPILLEDEMA ON FUNDUS CAMERA WITH CNN
a) Retina Images Obtained by Fundus Camera:

Headache is the most common clinical symptom worldwide. The lifetime prevalence of headache was calculated as 96%. This clinical complaint, which almost everyone experiences at least once in their lifetime, constitutes the majority of patients who apply to neurology outpatient clinics. There are primary and secondary causes of headache. Although headaches due to primary causes reduce the quality of life, they are not life-threatening. Clinical conditions such as brain tumors that are secondary causes of headache and life-threatening, and increased intracranial hypertension that can cause permanent vision loss can be understood with a simple, inexpensive and non-invasive method such as fundus evaluation. Although it is a cheap and easily accessible examination, fundus evaluation should be performed by experienced physicians. For this reason, it is very common to consult eye diseases in order to better evaluate patients with headache complaints. These patients, who were consulted with an ophthalmologist, both increase the workload and increase the patient density due to the fact that they are examined in an extra department. In addition, mydriatic (pupillary enlargement) group drugs are given to patients for examination in Ophthalmology outpatient clinics, and this group of drugs causes a loss of time since the effect time is about half an hour.
Retinal imaging is routinely provided with a fundus camera in the clinic. Images taken with a fundus camera are kept in the hospital database in digital environment. Normal and papilledema images in the database will be selected by the ophthalmologist and included in the project (Figure-1). Since the device planned to be turned into a product in the project will also receive fundus camera-like images, it was deemed appropriate to process retinal images obtained with a fundus camera within the scope of the project.
